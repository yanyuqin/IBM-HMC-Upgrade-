# Power 824升级微码

## 小版本升级-o a -l latestconcurrent
## 大版本升级  -o u -t syspower  必须关闭所有分区poweroff后执行，需要重新IPL
### 注意：/tmp/fwupdate必须有三个文件 .rpm .xml .html,否则升级失败

All updates are concurrent.
```
### 正式升级

```

HSCF0178W Operation completed successfully for FY4A_NA7824_HA_10_XSERIAL (8286-42A*XSERIAL).  Deferred Fixes are present in the fixpack.
The following deferred fixes are present in the fix pack.  Deferred fixes will be activated after the next IPL of the system.
An immediate IPL is not required, unless you want to activate one of the fixes below now.

HIPER /NON-PERVASIVE  On systems with DDR4 memory installed, a problem was fixed for the handling of data errors in the L4 cache.   If a data error occurs in the L4 cache of the memory buffer on an affected system and it is pushed out to mainline memory, the data error will not be correctly handled.   A data error originating in the L4 cache may result in incorrect data being stored into memory.  The DDR4 DRAM has feature code (FC) EM8S for a 128GB 1600 MHz CDIMM. IBM strongly recommends that the customer should plan an outage to install the firmware fix immediately.  Fix activation requires a subsequent platform IPL following the installation of the firmware fix to eliminate any exposure to this issue. This problem only exists on the 8408-E8E systems with the DDR4 DRAM memory feature. (999713/SW358897)On systems using PowerVM firmware, a problem was fixed for PCIe3 I/O expansion drawer (EMX0) link improved stability.  The settings for the continuous time linear equalizers (CTLE) was updated for all the PCIe adapters for the PCIe links to the expansion drawer.  The CEC must be re-IPLed for the fix to activate.
